## Interpolation
<dl>
    <dt> Linear interpolation </dt>
    <dd> is the determination of the coefficients of a straight line passing through several given points. The values at the point are determined by the straight line formula. </dd>
    <dt> Lagrange interpolation polynomial </dt>
    <dd> is a polynomial of minimal degree that takes these values in a given set of points </dd>
    <dt> Spline </dt>
    <dd> is function, the domain of which is divided into a finite number of segments on which it coincides with some algebraic polynomial </dd>

#### Run program
* download all using command `git clone https://github.com/i-n-d-i/num_methods/tree/master/3rd_homework`
* run program using `python3 programName.py`

#### Example of filling out documents:

##### train.dat
```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
##### train.ans

```
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

##### test.dat 
```
10
0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 12
```

#### The answer will be written to the document test.ans

#### All programs have the same result
